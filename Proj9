# Continous Integration Pipeline For Tooling Website

 ## STEP 1.  **Provision Jenkins Server**


1. I created an EC2 instance based on Ubuntun 22.04 adn named it `Jenkins`, to install Jenkins, I ran the following commands;
 ```bash 
 # Install JDK
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jdk-headless -y

# Install Jenkins:
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

#Confirm Jenkins is running
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

2. I confirmed the installation by pasting the public IP address of the `Jenkins Server` in a web brwoser along with the default port (8080) which Jenkins uses.

3. I performed the initial setup by first getting the Admin password by running 
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```
then i installed plugins, created an admin user and was done with the inital setup.

>To effect this changes, I restarted the apache service `sudo systemctl restart apache2`

 ## STEP 2.  **Configure Jenkins to retrieve source codes from GitHub using Webhooks**
3. I verified my setup thus far by putting the public IP address of the LoadBalancer in the browser and voila!!!

4. On each of the web-servers, I unmounted the logs directory from the `/mnt/logs` directory on the NFS Server by running;
```bash
sudo umount -l /var/log/httpd
```
> used the -l as it was returning a mount point busy error.

5. I restarted both servers and anytime i refreshed webpage of the loadbalancer  I was able to read their access logs (increasing in turns) by running 
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log
```

NOTES: This was an interesting one as i learnt of the various Load balancing comcepts and some scenarios where they can be deployed.
